Vengeance upon the Greater Warped One Ged-that was the purpose that gave Gillion's life meaning.  

Gillion was born in a small and unremarkable village on the continent's frontier. There, amidst a humble peace, he grew under the warmth of his parents' love, learning the hard-earned wisdom of life from his father, once a mercenary.  

"The day the Abyss opens draws near."  

His father often said this, a shielding arm around his son.  

Even as a child, Gillion could feel the fear beneath those words, and he carved his father's teachings deep into his heart.  

His father's words became reality when Gillion was thirteen. The Abyss yawned wide, swallowing the village whole, and the Greater Warped One's onslaught fell upon the village. Gillion tried to stand and fight beside his father. But his father, seeking to save Gillion, gave him a mission of his own.  

"I entrust them all to you. Swear that you will protect them."  

Sensing the weight of his father's resolve, Gillion nodded solemnly, and swore to protect without fail. Taking his mother's hand, he led the villagers away, fleeing through smoke and ruin as the Warped Ones gave chase.

Days passed, and from a neighboring elven realm a troop of elves made its way to the place that had once been Gillion's village, having sensed the disturbance in the currents of the world. There they found only ruin-the bodies of the villagers scattered and desecrated by the Warped Ones-and amid the silence of death, within the hollow of a tree, they discovered a boy still clinging to life. Before that hollow, the torn remains of a woman-his mother, most likely-lay as though she had fallen protecting him.  

The elves bore away this sole survivor, Gillion, taking him into their custody. The taint of the Abyss had already begun to consume him, but through the skill and unrelenting will of an elven mystic, his life was wrested back from the brink.  

When Gillion awoke, he was wracked with guilt. He had been unable to help his father. He had failed to uphold his vow. He had watched as the villagers perished before his eyes. And his mother had died shielding him, giving her life that he might live.  

He set out to learn all he could of his nemesis, gathering every whisper and fragment of knowledge. The name of his nemesis was Ged, the Greater Warped One. It sought out the mighty and preyed upon them. And from those he deemed heroes, he carried off their weapons as his prize. Gillion's father had been strong. That was why he had been marked. When Gillion had come to learn this truth, a twisted smile spread across his face.
