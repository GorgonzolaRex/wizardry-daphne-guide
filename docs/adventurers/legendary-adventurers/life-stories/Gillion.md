Vengeance upon the Greater Warped One Ged-that was the purpose that gave Gillion's life meaning.  

Gillion was born in a small and unremarkable village on the continent's frontier. There, amidst a humble peace, he grew under the warmth of his parents' love, learning the hard-earned wisdom of life from his father, once a mercenary.  

"The day the Abyss opens draws near."  

His father often said this, a shielding arm around his son.  

Even as a child, Gillion could feel the fear beneath those words, and he carved his father's teachings deep into his heart.  

His father's words became reality when Gillion was thirteen. The Abyss yawned wide, swallowing the village whole, and the Greater Warped One's onslaught fell upon the village. Gillion tried to stand and fight beside his father. But his father, seeking to save Gillion, gave him a mission of his own.  

"I entrust them all to you. Swear that you will protect them."  

Sensing the weight of his father's resolve, Gillion nodded solemnly, and swore to protect without fail. Taking his mother's hand, he led the villagers away, fleeing through smoke and ruin as the Warped Ones gave chase.
