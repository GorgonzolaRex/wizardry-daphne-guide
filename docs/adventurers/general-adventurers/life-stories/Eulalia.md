A small elven kingdom can be found nestled within the massive mountain range along the northern boundary of the country. There, Eulalia was born to the captain of the kingdom's order of knights, defenders of the realm.  

That summer was unusually cold. The forest was not bountiful, and before winter vermin frequently appeared, even in the elven villages, consuming both livestock and scarce crops.  

Commander of the knights, Eulalia's father spent his days moving around, eradicating these vermin, but the beasts were not the only ones who were starving. The settlement where he was stationed was attacked by a gang of thieves from across the border, come for plunder.  

Although they were repulsed, Eulalia's father was gravely wounded. He might have recovered had there been enough food and time to rest, but alas, the poor fall harvest meant a winter of starvation, even for the otherwise hardy.

On his deathbed, Eulalia's father entrusted his duty to her, and she became a knight protecting the kingdom.  

"None shall ever encroach upon this nation again."  

Eulalia and the remnants of the knights hunted through the mountains until harvest season, rounding up the thieves coming across the border. They patrolled the forest every day, working diligently to exterminate vermin during their early spring breeding season.  

Throughout all this, Eulalia worked tirelessly and devotedly as a knight of the kingdom.

Others who had survived, entrusted with the carrying on, pooled their knowledge and prepared for the cold summers and too-long winters to come.  

With the cooperation of the people and the knights' steady eradication campaign, the kingdom gradually became stronger, though truly little by little, to the extent that it could survive the winter with its reserves alone.  

Before she knew it, 100 years had passed since the death of Eulalia's father. No longer would anyone lose their lives because they could not survive the winter in Eulalia's kingdom.

Pleased with Eulalia's fine work so far, the king suggested she take some time for herself.  

After all, everyone in the kingdom knew of her tireless efforts since the death of her father.  

"But you must return. Your nation needs you."  

Eulalia bowed deeply at the king's words and answered, "Indeed. A chance to broaden my horizons like this may never come again." And thus she set off, seeking the royal capital seeking new knowledge that might enrich her nation, and seeking greater honors as a knight.
